    <h2 id="Sindh">Sindh</h2>
    <p>is a province of Pakistan. Located in the southeastern region of the country, Sindh is the third-largest province
        of Pakistan by land area and the second-largest province by population after Punjab. It is bordered by the
        Pakistani provinces of Balochistan to the west and north-west and Punjab to the north. It shares an
        International border with the Indian states of Gujarat and Rajasthan to the east; it is also bounded by the
        Arabian Sea to the south. Sindh's landscape consists mostly of alluvial plains flanking the Indus River, the
        Thar Desert of Sindh in the eastern portion of the province along the international border with India, and the
        Kirthar Mountains in the western portion of the province.

        The economy of Sindh is the second-largest in Pakistan after the province of Punjab; its provincial capital of
        Karachi is the most populous city in the country as well as its main financial hub. Sindh is home to a large
        portion of Pakistan's industrial sector and contains two of the country's busiest commercial seaports: Port
        Qasim and the Port of Karachi. The remainder of Sindh consists of an agriculture-based economy and produces
        fruits, consumer items and vegetables for other parts of the country.[7][8][9]

        Sindh is sometimes referred to as the Bab-ul Islam (transl'Gateway of Islam'), as it was one of the first
        regions of the Indian subcontinent to fall under Islamic rule.[10][11] Ethnic Sindhi people constitute the
        largest group in the province; Sindh is also the place of residence for the overwhelming majority of Muhajirs
        (lit'migrants'), a multiethnic group of Indian Muslims who migrated to the region after the Partition of
        British India in 1947. The province is well known for its distinct culture, which is strongly influenced by
        Sufist Islam, an important marker of Sindhi identity for both Hindus and Muslims.[12] Sindh is prominent for its
        history during the Bronze Age under the Indus Valley civilization, and is home to two UNESCO-designated World
        Heritage Sites: the Makli Necropolis and Mohenjo-daro.[13]</p>
    <h2 id="Isb">Islamabad</h2>
    <p>The name Islamabad means City of Islam. It is derived from two words: Islam and abad. Islam refers to the
        religion of Islam, Pakistan's state religion, and -abad is a Persian suffix meaning cultivated place, indicating
        an inhabited place or city.[20] According to a history book by Muhammad Ismail Zabeeh, teacher and poet Qazi
        Abdur Rehman Amritsari proposed the name of the city.[21][22]

        Occasionally in writing, Islamabad is colloquially abbreviated ISB. Such usage originated in SMS language, in
        part due to the IATA location identifier for the Islamabad International Airport.Islamabad Capital Territory,
        located on the Pothohar Plateau of the northern Punjab region, is considered one of the earliest sites of human
        settlement in Asia.[23] Some of the earliest Stone Age artefacts in the world have been found on the plateau,
        dating from 100,000 to 500,000 years ago. Rudimentary stones recovered from the terraces of the Soan River
        testify to the endeavours of early man in the inter-glacial period.[24] Items of pottery and utensils dating
        back to prehistory have been found.[25]

        Excavations by Dr. Abdul Ghafoor Lone reveal evidence of a prehistoric culture in the area. Relics and human
        skulls have been found dating back to 50ormerly known as Lyallpur (Punjabi, Urdu: لائل پور), is the second
        largest city and industrial centre of the Pakistani province of Punjab. It is an industrial and metropolitan
        hub, being the third most populous city in Pakistan, with an estimated population of 3.7 million in 2023.
        Located in central Punjab's Rachna Do'āb, between the Ravi and Chenab rivers, it is the second-largest
        Punjabi-speaking city in the world. Faisalabad is one of Pakistan's wealthiest and most industrialized city, the
        largest industrial hub and second largest city of the wider Punjab region.

        Historically one of the largest villages of Punjab, Lyallpur was one of the first planned cities within British
        India.00 BCE that indicate the region was home to Neolithic peoples who
        settled on the banks of the Soan[23] and who later developed small communities in the region around 3000
        BCE.[24][26]

        The Indus Valley civilization flourished in the region between the 23rd and 18th centuries BCE. Later the area
        was an early settlement of the Aryan community which migrated into the region from Central Asia.[23] Many great
        armies such as those of Zahiruddin Babur, Genghis Khan, Timur and Ahmad Shah Durrani crossed the region during
        their invasions of the Indian subcontinent.[23][27] In 2015 -16, the Federal Department of Archaeology and
        Museums, with the financial support of National Fund for Cultural Heritage, carried out initial archaeological
        excavations in which unearthed the remains of a Buddhist stupa at Ban Faqiran, near the Shah Allah Ditta caves,
        which was dated to the 2nd to the 5th century CE.[28]
